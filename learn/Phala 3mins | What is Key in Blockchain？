Cryptography is the basis for cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin, which are used to create public and private keys in pairs to prevent the leak of private data. The relationship can be understood as: your neighbors or the mailman can insert letters and notes through the opening of your mailbox. However, the only person that can retrieve the contents of the mailbox is the one that has the unique key. Besides, there is no central database that can track the private key in the blockchain, so the transaction cannot be completed if the user loses the private key.

The blockchain wallet automatically generates a private key composed of alphanumeric characters. These digital characters allow a user to access and control the money at its corresponding cryptocurrency address; that is, the private key indicates the user's ownership of the money. When a user sends a transaction request, the network creates a unique digital signature for each transaction and signs it with a private key, thus indicating to the entire network that the user is authorized and the transaction is completed.

A public key is a simplified version of a private key created through complex mathematical algorithms. It is used in elliptic curve cryptography as a means of producing a one-way function, which is easy to compute in one direction, but difficult to do so in the opposite, making the transaction confidential. The address, which can then be used in transactions, is a shorter, representative form of the public key.
