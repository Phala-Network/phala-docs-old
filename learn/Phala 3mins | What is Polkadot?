Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol connecting multiple specialized blockchains into one unified network. Designed as part of a broad vision for a web that returns control to individuals over internet monopolies, Polkadot enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure, trust-free environment.

There are four roles involved in Polkadot: validator, nominator, collector and fisherman, who have their own responsibilities and will be rewarded or slashed according to their performance. Polkadot uses NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake) as its mechanism for selecting the validator set, which also encourages DOT holders to participate as nominators.

Polkadot was created by former Eth founder Dr. Gavin Wood and Parity, a former Eth development team. Gavin Wood has laid out the Web3.0 vision for a freer, safer and more equal use of Internet protocols. Polkadot is also a thriving ecosystem, with emerging projects such as Acala, Bifrost, Crust, Phala in various fields :). It is also one of the most anticipated public chains in the world.
